                  <span>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! If you are here, it is either because I forced you to look at my site, or you might be interested in learning more about me as a developer. Either way, I appreciate you taking the time to visit me here!</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>A little about me and my experiences: my name is Shawn, and I currently reside in Roseville, MN, with my son and wife. Over the course of my life, I have held many jobs. In college, I worked as a bouncer in a small rural bar. The next summer, I worked with a Private Detective working insurance fraud and skip traces in the surrounding states. After being chased through the wetlands of Alabama by a dog and a shot-gun wielding cabin dweller in the middle of nowhere, I decided to leave the exciting world of a private detective for a much safer career in warehouse management. I don't like to brag, but I was a bit of a name in the warehouse business for about a year. Message me if you would like to hear more about my brush with semi-stardom!</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>In MN, I have been on many new adventures! I returned to the world of IT and began finding a new passion for development. After another layoff from the IT world, I found myself wanting to do work that really mattered. So I went back to school and became a certified veterinary technician, specializing in physical therapy and massage. I ran a successful pet care company for 6 years before a car accident left me unable to handle the rigors of handling animals.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>Since my retirment from animal care, I have become well versed in remote work. I have spearhead the creation and growth of two school theatre programs in Stillwater, MN. In my downtime, I have been relearning the exciting world of html/css development! I had forgotten how much I loved it! So much that I am attending a remote bootcamp in June to further my development skills.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>That is me in a nutshell! Please check out my protfolio page if you would like to see some examples of my work. Thank you very much for your time! I wish you a peaceful and joyful day!</span>
